=head1 NAME

AnyEvent::MPRPC::Client - Simple TCP-based MessagePack RPC client

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use AnyEvent::MPRPC::Client;

    my $client = AnyEvent::MPRPC::Client->new(
        host => '127.0.0.1',
        port => 4423,
    );

    # blocking interface
    my $res = $client->call( echo => 'foo bar' )->recv; # => 'foo bar';

    # non-blocking interface
    $client->call( echo => 'foo bar' )->cb(sub {
        my $res = $_[0]->recv;  # => 'foo bar';
    });

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is client part of L<AnyEvent::MPRPC>.

=head2 AnyEvent condvars

The main thing you have to remember is that all the data retrieval methods
return an AnyEvent condvar, C<$cv>.  If you want the actual data from the
request, there are a few things you can do.

You may have noticed that many of the examples in the SYNOPSIS call C<recv>
on the condvar.  You're allowed to do this under 2 circumstances:

=over 4

=item Either you're in a main program,

Main programs are "allowed to call C<recv> blockingly", according to the
author of L<AnyEvent>.

=item or you're in a Coro + AnyEvent environment.

When you call C<recv> inside a coroutine, only that coroutine is blocked
while other coroutines remain active.  Thus, the program as a whole is
still responsive.

=back

If you're not using Coro, and you don't want your whole program to block,
what you should do is call C<cb> on the condvar, and give it a coderef to
execute when the results come back.  The coderef will be given a condvar
as a parameter, and it can call C<recv> on it to get the data.  The final
example in the SYNOPSIS gives a brief example of this.

Also note that C<recv> will throw an exception if the request fails, so be
prepared to catch exceptions where appropriate.

Please read the L<AnyEvent> documentation for more information on the proper
use of condvars.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new (%options)

Create new client object and return it.

    my $client = AnyEvent::MRPPC::Client->new(
        host => '127.0.0.1',
        port => 4423,
        %options,
    );

Available options are:

=over 4

=item host => 'Str'

Hostname to connect. (Required)

You should set this option to "unix/" if you will set unix socket to port option.

=item port => 'Int | Str'

Port number or unix socket path to connect. (Required)

=item on_error => $cb->($handle, $fatal, $message)

Error callback code reference, which is called when some error occured.
This has same arguments as L<AnyEvent::Handle>, and also act as handler's on_error callback.

Default is just croak.

=item on_connect => $cb->($self, $filehandle, $host, $port, $retry)

After the connection is established, then this callback will be invoked.

If the connect is unsuccessful, then the $connect_cb will be invoked without any arguments and $! will be set appropriately.

See '$connect_cb' in L<AnyEvent::Socket> for more details.

=item handler_options => 'HashRef'

This is passed to constructor of L<AnyEvent::Handle> that is used manage connection.

Default is empty.

=back

=head2 call ($method, @params)

Call remote method named C<$method> with parameters C<@params>. And return condvar object for response.

    my $cv = $client->call( echo => 'Hello!' );
    my $res = $cv->recv;

If server returns an error, C<<$cv->recv>> causes croak by using C<<$cv->croak>>. So you can handle this like following:

    my $res;
    eval { $res = $cv->recv };

    if (my $error = $@) {
        # ...
    }
