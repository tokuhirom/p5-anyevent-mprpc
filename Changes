    commit 4f6db620d1b0b86f776946f4d8688dc9fc69c966

        A read_type AnyEvent handler must call the callback only once per
        call, else one have a risk of memleak by pushing/shifting too many
        "read" callbacks in the read queue.
        And so each read callback should re-arm itself (if needed) in the read
        queue. Using on_read callback to do that is a mistake, as on_read can
        be called several times before a complete messagepack packet is
        received.
